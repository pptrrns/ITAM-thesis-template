    - The files are provided in the folder `fonts`.
3. Personalize the document by filling out your name and information in `frontmatter/personalize.tex` and in `endmatter/personalize.tex`. 
4. Personalize the abstract, preface, and acknowledgments in the folder `frontmatter`.
5. Edit the files located in `chapters` to add the content of your thesis (chapters and appendices).
